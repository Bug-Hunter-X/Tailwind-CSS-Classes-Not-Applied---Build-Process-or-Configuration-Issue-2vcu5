# Tailwind CSS Classes Not Applied

This repository demonstrates a common yet often perplexing issue in Tailwind CSS projects:  Tailwind directives are seemingly ignored, even after correctly importing `tailwind.css`. The application builds and runs without errors, but expected styles don't appear. This frequently points to misconfigurations in the build pipeline or Tailwind's setup.

## Steps to Reproduce:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies.
3. Run `npm start` (or your project's equivalent) to start the development server.

Observe that the styled elements do not render with the anticipated Tailwind classes, despite the correct imports and seemingly correct class names.
